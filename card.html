					Wolves are a class of the canine family, and they seem
					to do very well in the right environment. In fact, they are the
					largest of all canines with exception of some dog species. They
					are meat eaters and can range in size considerably depending on
					where they live. Some of them are only about 55 pounds full grown
					while others can be up to 200 pounds. They can range in size from
					40 to 65 inches in length. Such a measurement is from the tip of
					the nose to the end of the tail.
